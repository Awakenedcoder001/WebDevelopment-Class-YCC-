<h1> Tom from tom and jerry </h1>

<p> Fans were on board with this answer and were quick to suggest several episodes where this theory was proven right. In some episodes, Tom and Jerry both are actually seen having a good time as they relax in their respective places and only indulge in fights when someone is around.

Another user claimed that an episode did air where Tom gets replaced by another cat. This episode further solidifies the theory as the other actually does want to kill Jerry. 
<br>However, Tom and Jerry join forces and manage to get the mechanical cat out of the house and thus Tom is back again. Towards the end of the episode, Tom is seen thanking Jerry and the two friends exchange a smile and get back with their usual tantrums and chases.

The Reddit thread has since then gotten many such inputs from fans who have been shedding light upon the fact that perhaps the two are not enemies after all but were best friends all al
<p>
<p>Tom and Jerry are best friends. But Tom has to pretend to hate Jerry in order to protect (Jerry) so Tom’s owner doesn’t replace (Tom) with a cat that actually wants to kill Jerry.</p>
