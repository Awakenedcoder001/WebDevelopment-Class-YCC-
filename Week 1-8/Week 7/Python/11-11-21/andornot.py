#Logical Operator
#And Operator
#and operator states that if one value is false, the statement printed out will be false. Also only if both the statements are true will the result printed be True.

#OR operator
#The OR operator states that if one statment is true then the result printed out will be True. Also only if both the statements are false will the result printed be false. Also
#x = 5
#print(x > 3 or x < 4)
#Result Printed out will be true
#print(x<3 or x>4)
#result printed will be true
#print(x<3 or x<5)
#result will be false as both the statements are False
#print(x<3 or x>4)
#result will be True as there is one value that is correct hence result willbe true

x = 5
print(not(x > 3 or x < 4))
#Not operator
#The not operator prints the reverse result. I.e What ever the result is from the above statment(the printed result will be the opposite, for eg the above result printed would be True but because of the NOT operator the result printed will be false)

x = 5
print(not(x < 3 or x < 4))
#True result

x=5
print(not(x >3 and x <5))
#True

x = 5
print(not(x > 3 or x < 4))
#False
